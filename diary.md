N/A

Began thinking about copy-make, legality checks and en-passant. Could check any blockers for the king, then work from there.
Or could get attack mask post blockers and & with king. Would simply use the magic gen but not split the moves into many.

26/10/2024 - 29/10/2024
Doing assignments and more interviews

25/10/2024
Added protocol for if there is an enpassant. Checking if en passant is caused to be done.

Used current magic techniques to generate all moves for all sliding pieces on all squares. En passant, castling and promotions to be done.

16/10/2024
Worked on generating move tables for sliding pieces using precomputed magics. Can now generate rook moves for all positions.

14/10/2024 - 15/10/2024
More work on magics.
Managed to generate magic numbers and corresponding tables

13/10/2024
Organised some code, ammended some errors on magics

12/10/2024
Continued work on magics, should be done tomorrow, made some notes in daybook about what to do.
